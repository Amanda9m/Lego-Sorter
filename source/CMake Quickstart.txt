To quickly get set up, go to a directory outside of this 
git repo and run

cmake /path/to/repo/source/folder -G <generator>

Where <generator> will usually be "Visual Studio 15 Win64"
on Windows and should probably be "Xcode" on Mac. (Note:
The quotes are needed in "Visual Studio 15 Win64" since
there are spaces in the parameter.) If these don't work
cmake will print out a list of possible generators that
can be used.
