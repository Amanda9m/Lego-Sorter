# Group 02 - LEGO Sorter

## Tentative Rating
Above Average Difficulty. My understanding is that you are following some general tutorial.

## Comments
 - I wonder how you intend to _detect_ whether a brick is in a region or not. That is a different problem altogether from classification. But then again, if you are following a tutorial on that, that's fine. Just keep in mind those are different problems.
 - I hope your prototype plan is more than what is described in the document.
