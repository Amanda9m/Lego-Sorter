Stuff to code
   - Brick Detection from tensor flow hopefully
   - Brick Classification checkish
       - Colour
       - Brick type GRAYSCALE ALL PICS IN THAT FILE
	- 
   - Brick-set management TODO (how entered)
	-Brick existence and led flash
   - Control system
   - Brick-set downloader (Maybe)


CURRENT TODO-S

- Grayscale all pics in block classifier by type
- re-run training
- make sure classification can be run from the raspberry pi / program that
- attach LED and program that
- create some form of set infrastructure and attach it to light / tensor flow calls, figure out speed based on that
